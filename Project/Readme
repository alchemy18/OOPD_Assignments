Class Structure:

Device: Base class for devices.
UserDevice and AccessPoint: Inherit from Device.
Packet: Represents data packets with timestamps for latency calculation.
FrequencyChannel: Models the frequency channel with sub-channel management.


Functionality:

Devices can send and receive packets.
Packet class allows for accurate latency measurements.
FrequencyChannel manages channel state and sub-channel allocations.

To build and run the simulator:
Compile:

 make

Run:

 ./wifi_simulator 10
 Replace 10 with 1 or 100 for different user scenarios.

 #note: the code is developed with help of open-source LLM
