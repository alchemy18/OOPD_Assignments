# Indian Railways Library and Test Program

This project provides a C++ library to simulate an Indian Railways management system. The library includes classes for `Platform`, `Line`, and `Station`, with support for managing railway lines, platforms, and stations. A test program (`main.cpp`) allows users to add, view, and manage stations.

## Project Structure

- **IndianRailways.h**: Header file defining the classes and functions for the library.
- **IndianRailways.cpp**: Implementation file for the library functions and methods.
- **main.cpp**: Test program that provides a menu-driven interface for interacting with the library.
- **Makefile**: A `Makefile` to compile and link the library and the test program.

## Requirements

- **Compiler**: `g++` (preferably with C++11 or later support)

## Compilation and Execution

### Using the Makefile

The `Makefile` automates the compilation and linking process. It has three main targets:

1. **Build the Test Program**: To compile and link the library with the test program, simply run:

   make
   make clean
   ./IndianRailwaysTest
